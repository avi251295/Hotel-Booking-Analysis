    The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservation that are canceled and those are not. It is obvious that there are 
    still significant number of reservation that have not been cancelled. There are still 37% of clients who cancelled their reservation, 
    which has a significant impact on the hotels’ earning.

#### Reservation Status in Different Hotel:

     In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It’s Possible that resort hotels 
     are more expensive than those in cities.

    As seen in the graph, reservation are cancelled when the average daily rate is 
    higher than when it is not cancelled. It clearly proves all the above analysis, that     
    higher price leads to higher cancellation.

#### Monthly Reservation Trend:

    As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservation and the number of canceled reservations are largest 
    in the month of August. Whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservations.

    This Bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are greatest and are least 
    common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.

    Let’s see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is Portugal with the highest number of cancellation.

##### Cancelation by Market Segment:

![Screenshot (83)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7a11d47-74fa-4b62-9e3e-d6e9f146a3b4)

    Around 46% cancelation come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% from groups. Only 4% cancelation 
    by the clients those book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservation.

## Suggestion:

    Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, 
    hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on location. 
    They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.
    
    As the ratio of cancelation and not cancelation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. 
    So the hotels should provides a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.
    
    In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as 
    the cancellation is the highest in this month.
    
    They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation.
